Description: Multi-Dimensional Analysis (MDA) is an adaptation of factor
  analysis developed by Douglas Biber. Its most common use is to describe
  language as it varies by genre, register, and use. This package contains
  functions for carrying out the calculations needed to describe and plot MDA
  results: dimension scores, dimension means, and factor loadings.
